    "body": "[The downstream bug for those playing at home](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1189036)\r\n\r\nI'm still not convinced about using `profile.d`. Could it mislead people into thinking fish reads `/etc/profile` or any of the other Bourne initialisation files? Do we want to go down the road of having some files that get read sometimes and not others? I found that enormously confusing when starting out with bash and zsh:\r\n\r\n> Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv.  If the shell is a login shell, commands are read from /etc/zsh/zprofile and then $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile.  Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are read from /etc/zsh/zshrc and then $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc.  Finally, if the shell is a login shell, /etc/zsh/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of autoloading, fish used `/etc/fish.d` for this sort of thing - see [the discussion from 2006](http://sourceforge.net/p/fish/mailman/message/6609911/). In keeping with the current pattern, that would now probably become `$__fish_sysconfdir/config.d/` or something similar.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate perspectives from other packagers - @tianon @mithrandi ?"

    "body": "@zanchey happy to jump in and provide opinions from both a Debian/Ubuntu and a Gentoo packaging perspective :+1:\r\n\r\nFor things like completions that really oughtn't be modified by users (unless they copy them wholesale), I definitely agree that somewhere in `/usr/share` is the place.  For user-specified stuff, something in `/etc` would be appropriate, but `/etc/profile.d/*.fish` sounds like a step backwards, since `/etc/profile.d` is traditionally for posix-compatible shells, and stretching that to include fish just to avoid a new directory in `/etc` feels wrong IMO.  The bit from the LSB spec that worries me is \"The behavior is unspecified if a script is installed in this directory that does not have the suffix .sh.\", since that means that implementations could 100% legitimately be sourcing any file in there as if it were posix shell, regardless of extension, and still be following the LSB spec to the letter.\r\n\r\nBoth Debian and Gentoo have been working to move away from package-installed scripts being in `/etc` because `/etc` is explicitly defined as \"user mutable knob storage\", essentially."

The admin should not need to touch the upstream directory because package managers (and the user should not have to touch the admin directory because... well, UNIX, privilege separation and all that). Every one of these groups should have their own directory.\r\n\r\nApart from the three groups of people, we have three types of code they might want to add:\r\n\r\n- Functions\r\n\r\n- Completions\r\n\r\n- Event handlers and other code that can't be autoloaded (this is unless we can come up with a better solution to the autoloading problem - calling it \"config\" as a catch-all for configuration that doesn't fit into the other two is also possible)\r\n\r\nWe already have the first two for users and fish itself, and I have proposed the third somewhere else already, but I can't come up with a good name for it.\r\n\r\nI don't consider /etc/profile.d a good solution because of the undefined behavior - we should not break other shells.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSo, now, with all that in mind, I propose the following solution:\r\n\r\n- Users get ~/.config/fish (replace with appropriate variable)\r\n\r\n- Admins get /etc/fish\r\n\r\n- Upstream gets /usr/share/fish/vendor_* (since vendor_completions.d already exists)\r\n\r\n- Every one of those gets subdirectories \"completions\", \"functions\" and \"event\" (final name TBD) (i.e. vendors/upstream get \"/usr/share/fish/vendor_functions.d\" and such)\r\n\r\n- The preference is User > Admin > Upstream > fish (not too sure about the latter two)\r\n\r\n- Completions and functions are autoloaded and named after the program they complete or function they provide, respectively, plus a \".fish\" extension\r\n\r\n- \"Event\" files are all sourced at startup in lexical order (unless we find a different solution - naming after the event plus a suffix is also possible to allow for multiple upstreams hooking into the same event)\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone think of this idea?"

    "body": "I like this.  I think that, if this happens, that fish should follow the\nsysctl / systemd model in which a file in ~/.config/fish/* that has the\nsame name as a file in /usr/share/fish/* overrides it and that a symlink\nfrom ~/.config/fish/* to /dev/null suppresses a similarly named file in\n/usr/share/fish/*, etc.\n\nOn Mon, Sep 14, 2015 at 1:01 PM, Fabian Homborg <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> My 2 cents:\n>\n> I'd like to step back from \"profile.d\" a bit here.\n> As far as I can see, there are three groups of people we should satisfy\n> with our configuration options:\n>\n>    -\n>\n>    Upstream software developers or distributions wishing to hook into\n>    fish (like the pantheon people, see #1382\n>    <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1382>)\n>    -\n>\n>    Admins wishing to add configuration for all users\n>    -\n>\n>    Users wishing to add configuration\n>\n> In particular, admins might wish to override upstream, and users might\n> wish to override both admins and upstream. The admin should not need to\n> touch the upstream directory because package managers (and the user should\n> not have to touch the admin directory because... well, UNIX, privilege\n> separation and all that). Every one of these groups should have their own\n> directory.\n>\n> Apart from the three groups of people, we have three types of code they\n> might want to add:\n>\n>    -\n>\n>    Functions\n>    -\n>\n>    Completions\n>    -\n>\n>    Event handlers and other code that can't be autoloaded (this is unless\n>    we can come up with a better solution to the autoloading problem - calling\n>    it \"config\" as a catch-all for configuration that doesn't fit into the\n>    other two is also possible)\n>\n> We already have the first two for users and fish itself, and I have\n> proposed the third somewhere else already, but I can't come up with a good\n> name for it.\n>\n> I don't consider /etc/profile.d a good solution because of the undefined\n> behavior - we should not break other shells.\n> ------------------------------\n>\n> So, now, with all that in mind, I propose the following solution:\n>\n>    -\n>\n>    Users get ~/.config/fish (replace with appropriate variable)\n>    -\n>\n>    Admins get /etc/fish\n>    -\n>\n>    Upstream gets /usr/share/fish/vendor_* (since vendor_completions.d\n>    already exists)\n>    -\n>\n>    Every one of those gets subdirectories \"completions\", \"functions\" and\n>    \"event\" (final name TBD) (i.e. vendors/upstream get\n>    \"/usr/share/fish/vendor_functions.d\" and such)\n>    -\n>\n>    The preference is User > Admin > Upstream > fish (not too sure about\n>    the latter two)\n>    -\n>\n>    Completions and functions are autoloaded and named after the program\n>    they complete or function they provide, respectively, plus a \".fish\"\n>    extension\n>    -\n>\n>    \"Event\" files are all sourced at startup in lexical order (unless we\n>    find a different solution - naming after the event plus a suffix is also\n>    possible to allow for multiple upstreams hooking into the same event)\n>\n> What does everyone think of this idea?\n>\n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1956#issuecomment-140190427>\n> .\n>\n"
